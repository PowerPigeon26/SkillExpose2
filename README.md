Hi! This is a rehash of another project, SkillExpose. This is an ASP.NET MVC project with CRUD capabilities. The project utilizes a database from MySQL to access the names of skills from videogames and associated information. Through the site, skills can be read, updated, created, and deleted. This project was for practicing the early steps of making an MVC site, see original repository SkillExpose to see the more advanced version of this project.
